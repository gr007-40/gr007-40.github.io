I have recently graduated from IUT, Dhaka in CSE. I have been actively involved in cybersecurity related stuffs
since 2021. I regularly participate in CTFs as a member of [`IUT GENESIS`](https://ctftime.org/team/175924) team.
We are currently the best in our country according to [`CTFtime.org`](https://ctftime.org/stats/BD). We have won several ctf
championships in our country. We also participated in organizing some of the reputed CTF competitions
in our country. I post some of my CTF writeups here.
